3. Click **Save** to add it to the table.

## Managing Tasks

## Persistence

All data is stored in memory during runtime. Data will reset when the application closes.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify JavaFX modules are properly set on the module path.
- Ensure `styles.css` and FXML files are present under `src/main/resources`.
- Consult the console output for stack traces and error details.
